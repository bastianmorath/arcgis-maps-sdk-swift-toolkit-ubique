/// The `FeatureFormView` component enables users to edit field values of a feature using
/// pre-configured forms, either from the Web Map Viewer or the Fields Maps Designer.
///
/// ![An image of the FeatureFormView component](FeatureFormView)
///
/// Forms are currently only supported in maps. The form definition is stored
/// in the web map itself and contains a title, description, and a list of "form elements".
///
/// `FeatureFormView` supports the display of form elements created by
/// the Map Viewer or Field Maps Designer, including:
///
/// - Attachments Element - used to display and edit attachments.
/// - Field Element - used to edit a single field of a feature with a specific "input type".
/// - Group Element - used to group elements together. Group Elements
/// can be expanded, to show all enclosed elements, or collapsed, hiding
/// the elements it contains.
/// - Text Element - used to display read-only plain or Markdown-formatted text.
/// - Utility Associations Element - used to edit associations in utility networks.
///
/// A Field Element has a single input type object. The following are the supported input types:
///
/// - Barcode - machine readable data
/// - Combo Box - long list of values in a coded value domain
/// - Date/Time - date/time picker
/// - Radio Buttons - short list of values in a coded value domain
/// - Switch - two mutually exclusive values
/// - Text Area - multi-line text area
/// - Text Box - single-line text box
///
/// **Features**
///
/// - Display a form editing view for a feature based on the feature form definition defined in a web map and obtained from either an `ArcGISFeature`, `ArcGISFeatureTable`, `FeatureLayer` or `SubtypeSublayer`.
/// - Uses native SwiftUI controls for editing, such as `TextEditor`, `TextField`, and `DatePicker` for consistent platform styling.
/// - Supports elements containing Arcade expression and automatically evaluates expressions for element visibility, editability, values, and "required" state.
/// - Add, delete, or rename feature attachments.
/// - Fully supports dark mode, as do all Toolkit components.
///
/// **Behavior**
///
/// As of 200.8, FeatureFormView uses a NavigationStack internally to support browsing utility network
/// associations. As a result, a FeatureFormView requires a navigation context isolated from any app-level
/// navigation. Basic apps without navigation can continue to place a FeatureFormView where desired.
/// More complex apps using NavigationStack or NavigationSplitView will need to relocate the FeatureFormView
/// outside of that navigation context. If the FeatureFormView can be presented modally (no background
/// interaction with the map is needed), consider using a Sheet. If a non-modal presentation is needed,
/// consider placing the FeatureFormView in a Floating Panel or Inspector, on the app-level navigation container.
/// On supported platforms, WindowGroups are another alternative to consider as a FeatureFormView container.
///
/// To see it in action, try out the [Examples](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-maps-sdk-swift-toolkit/tree/main/Examples/Examples)
/// and refer to [FeatureFormExampleView.swift](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-maps-sdk-swift-toolkit/blob/main/Examples/Examples/FeatureFormExampleView.swift)
/// in the project. To learn more about using the `FeatureFormView` see the <doc:FeatureFormViewTutorial>.
///
/// - Note: In order to capture video and photos as form attachments, your application will need
/// `NSCameraUsageDescription` and, `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` entries in the
/// `Info.plist` file.
///
